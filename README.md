There are a lot of frameworks for ESP32 available.
I decided to make my own according my wishes and requirements.

Requirements in short:
- WLAN access data should not be hard coded in the software
- Basic configuration should be performed via terminal software
- Configuration data stored in emulated EEPROM
- Mechanism in place to handle NTP Time with RTC backup if required
- Support of at least two OLED-Versions to implement a clock in a easy way
- Support for humidity and temperature module to expand possible use cases
- ....
